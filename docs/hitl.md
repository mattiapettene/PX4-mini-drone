# Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation
<br>
Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) is a simulation mode in which normal PX4 firmware is run on a real flight controller hardware. The flight controller hardware is connected to Gazebo Classic via USB/UART.Ã¹

## HITL setup

### QGroundControl configuration
First of all it is necessary to configure QGroundControl to enable the HITL mode:
- Connect the flight controller directly to QGroundControl via USB
- Enable HITL mode, openening <code> Setup > Safety </code>
- Select the airframe, choosing Setup > Airframes > HIL Quadcopter
- Calibrate the RC and enable it setting COM_RC_OVERRIDE = 3

ADD PART TO DISABLE MAVLINK AND SET MICROXRCE

Then close QGroundControl to proceed with the remaining setup.

### Companion board configuration
During the HITL simulation, the commands to the flight controller are sent by a companion board, which in our case is a Raspberry Pi 4. To configure it:
- Install ROS2 in the same way reported [here](https://github.com/mattiapettene/PX4-mini-drone/blob/main/docs/toolchain_installation.md)
- Clone the repo with the script to be launched

## HITL simulation
### Gazebo launch
First of all make sure QGroundControl is closed. Then launch the following from a terminal: <br>
``` 
cd ~/PX4-Autopilot
DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo-classic 
source Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
gazebo Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic/worlds/hitl_iris.world
```
Only at this point it is possible to launch QGroundControl.

### ROS2 launch
On the companion board, launch ROS2:
```
source ~/microros_ws/install/local_setup.bash
source install/local_setup.bash
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyS0 -b 921600 ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
```
